/// The causative agent(s) that are responsible for the pathophysiologic process that
/// eventually results in a medical condition, symptom or sign. In this schema, unless otherwise
/// specified this is meant to be the proximate cause of the medical condition, symptom or
/// sign. The proximate cause is defined as the causative agent that most directly results
/// in the medical condition, symptom or sign. For example, the HIV virus could be considered
/// a cause of AIDS. Or in a diagnostic context, if a patient fell and sustained a hip fracture
/// and two days later sustained a pulmonary embolism which eventuated in a cardiac arrest,
/// the cause of the cardiac arrest (the proximate cause) would be the pulmonary embolism
/// and not the fall. Medical causes can include cardiovascular, chemical, dermatologic,
/// endocrine, environmental, gastroenterologic, genetic, hematologic, gynecologic,
/// iatrogenic, infectious, musculoskeletal, neurologic, nutritional, obstetric,
/// oncologic, otolaryngologic, pharmacologic, psychiatric, pulmonary, renal, rheumatologic,
/// toxic, traumatic, or urologic causes; medical conditions can be causes as well.
