/// A [[CompleteDataFeed]] is a [[DataFeed]] whose standard representation includes
/// content for every item currently in the feed. This is the equivalent of Atom's element
/// as defined in Feed Paging and Archiving [RFC 5005](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005),
/// for example (and as defined for Atom), when using data from a feed that represents a collection
/// of items that varies over time (e.g. "Top Twenty Records") there is no need to have newer
/// entries mixed in alongside older, obsolete entries. By marking this feed as a CompleteDataFeed,
/// old entries can be safely discarded when the feed is refreshed, since we can assume the
/// feed has provided descriptions for all current items.
