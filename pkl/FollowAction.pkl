/// Unlike SubscribeAction, FollowAction implies that the follower acts as an active agent
/// constantly/actively polling for updates. * [[RegisterAction]]: Unlike RegisterAction,
/// FollowAction implies that the agent is interested in continuing receiving updates
/// from the object. * [[JoinAction]]: Unlike JoinAction, FollowAction implies that the
/// agent is interested in getting updates from the object. * [[TrackAction]]: Unlike TrackAction,
/// FollowAction refers to the polling of updates of all aspects of animate objects rather
/// than the location of inanimate objects (e.g. you track a package, but you don't follow
/// it).
