/// A [[Claim]] in Schema.org represents a specific, factually-oriented claim that could
/// be the [[itemReviewed]] in a [[ClaimReview]]. The content of a claim can be summarized
/// with the [[text]] property. Variations on well known claims can have their common identity
/// indicated via [[sameAs]] links, and summarized with a [[name]]. Ideally, a [[Claim]]
/// description includes enough contextual information to minimize the risk of ambiguity
/// or inclarity. In practice, many claims are better understood in the context in which
/// they appear or the interpretations provided by claim reviews. Beyond [[ClaimReview]],
/// the Claim type can be associated with related creative works - for example a [[ScholarlyArticle]]
/// or [[Question]] might be [[about]] some [[Claim]]. At this time, Schema.org does not
/// define any types of relationship between claims. This is a natural area for future exploration.
