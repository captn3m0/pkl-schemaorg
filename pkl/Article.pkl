    /// of possible 'content-locator' values: 1.) *id-value* URL references - uses *id-value*

    /// relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.
    /// 2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute.
    /// Use the [[cssSelector]] property. 3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming
    /// an XML view of the content). Use the [[xpath]] property. For more sophisticated markup
    /// of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions
    /// to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, [[SpeakableSpecification]]
    /// which is defined to be a possible value of the *speakable* property.
