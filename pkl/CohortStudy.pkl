/// Also known as a panel study. A cohort study is a form of longitudinal study used in medicine
/// and social science. It is one type of study design and should be compared with a cross-sectional
/// study. A cohort is a group of people who share a common characteristic or experience within
/// a defined period (e.g., are born, leave school, lose their job, are exposed to a drug or
/// a vaccine, etc.). The comparison group may be the general population from which the cohort
/// is drawn, or it may be another cohort of persons thought to have had little or no exposure
/// to the substance under investigation, but otherwise similar. Alternatively, subgroups
/// within the cohort may be compared with each other.
